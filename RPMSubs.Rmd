Goal: Find RPM (Real Plus/Minus) for a team throughout game, and impact of substitutions

Read Data
```{r}
install.packages('plyr')
library('plyr')
playbyplay <- read.table("Hackathon_play_by_play.txt")
players_teams <- read.table("Hackathon_player_names_matched_team.txt")
```

First, RPM of a player throughout a game
```{r}

```

Substitutions
```{r}
subsdata<- playbyplay[which(playbyplay$Event_Description == "Substitution"),]
subsdata<- subset(subsdata,select = -c(Event_Msg_Type,Event_Num,Period,Home_Team_id,Away_Team_id,WC_Time,SC_Time,Date_EST,Event_Description))
subsdata[c("Team","sub_in","sub_out")]<- NA
```

```{r Find Names of Subs}
find_subs <- function(str,game_id) {
  # Return a 1x3 vector, [0] = team name, [1] = full name of subbed in, [2] = full name of subbed out
  in_name <- unlist(strsplit(str, " "))[6] #This person starts playing i.e. goes in
  out_name <- unlist(strsplit(str, " "))[2] #This person stops playing i.e. comes out
  #print(in_name)
  #print(out_name)
  temp_name_space <- players_teams[which(players_teams$Game_id == game_id), "Name"]
  #print(temp_name_space)
  for(name in temp_name_space) {
    #print(name)
    if(grepl(in_name,name)){
      real_in_name <- name
    }
    if(grepl(out_name,name)){
      real_out_name <- name
    }
  }
  
  res <- c(team, real_in_name,real_out_name)
  return (res)
}
```
